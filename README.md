How to run the application

Backend Services
>
To Start Backend Services follow below steps.
>Using Intellij/Eclipse or Command Line

Import this project into IDE and run all Spring boot projects or 
build all the jars running `mvn clean install` command in root parent pom, which builds all jars.

But running this way we wont get monitoring of microservices. 
So if monitoring needed to see metrics like jvm memory, tomcat error count and other metrics.

Use below method to deploy all the services and monitoring setup in docker.

Use the `Postman Api collection` in the Postman directory. To make request to various services.
